# 🧠 End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline (Production-Ready)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** using Scikit-learn’s Pipeline and ColumnTransformer APIs.

The objective is to build a production-ready ML workflow that:
- Loads and preprocesses data
- Trains a machine learning model
- Evaluates performance
- Saves model and reports automatically
- Follows real-world project structure

This project simulates how ML systems are built in real production environments.
